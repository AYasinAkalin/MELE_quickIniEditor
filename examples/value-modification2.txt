Add the lines below explanation to MOD\ME1\ModsToBIOEngine.txt

When you run the tool it will replace value of 'GameName'
from 'Mass Effect 'to 'Mass Effect 655' in Mass Effect 1's BIOEngine.ini.
It will specifically look under 'URL' section in BIOEngine.ini and no other places.

After first line the program will replace value of 'bEnableSpam'
from 'False 'to 'True' in the same file.
It will search entirity of BIOEngine.ini to find `bEnableSpam=False` line.

This is a replacement because there is a key-value pair without any spaces,
special delimiter ';;' without any spaces before and after it,
and another key-value pair after delimiter with the same key but different value than before.
You can add a section designation but it is optional.
