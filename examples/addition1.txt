Add the line below explanation to MOD\ME1\ModsToGamerSettings.txt

When you run the tool it will automatically try to add
what you wrote because there is nothing BEFORE special delimiter ';;' 

1st line) First it will add a section named 'URL' because there is no such section inside
GamerSettings.ini
Then it will add 'NewOption=False1' under 'URL' section.

2nd line) Then it will look for a section 'A.New.Section'. If there is no section,
it will create it, next add the line 'NewOption=Fals2e' under 'A.New.Section'

3rd line) Now the program again look for the section 'A.New.Section'. This time 
it will find it because we definitely created it just before.
It will try to add 'NewOption=Fals2e' under that section but won't because it will
detect an exact line there.
That means you can't add duplicates. Program do not create duplicates even if you try hard.

4th line) Program will create a section named 'B.New.Section', if it isn't present.
Then it will put 'Number=9995.12f' under this new section.

These are addition operations because there is nothing before ';;'.

You must add a section name using '@[SectionN]' syntax at the end the line
if you want to make addition.
