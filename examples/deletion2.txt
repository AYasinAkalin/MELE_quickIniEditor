Add the line below explanation to MOD\ME2\ModsToBIOGame.txt
When you run the tool it will delete 'MaxScore' with value '500'
under the section 'SFXGame.SFXDifficulty_Level6' from Mass Effect 2's BIOGame.ini.

There are other "MaxScore" in ME2's BIOGame.ini, but they won't be touched
because we explicitly stated a section name for deletion.

This is a deletion because there is between ';;' and '@['

MaxScore=500;;@[SFXGame.SFXDifficulty_Level6]
